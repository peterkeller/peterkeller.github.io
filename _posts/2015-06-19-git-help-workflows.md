Oh, did you know that?  Showing info about Git workflow:

{% highlight sh %}
> git help workflows
{% endhighlight %}

This prints a nice overview about the Git workflow:

{% highlight sh %}
GITWORKFLOWS(7)                                                    Git Manual                                                    GITWORKFLOWS(7)

NAME
       gitworkflows - An overview of recommended workflows with Git

SYNOPSIS
       git *

DESCRIPTION
       This document attempts to write down and motivate some of the workflow elements used for git.git itself. Many ideas apply in general,
       though the full workflow is rarely required for smaller projects with fewer people involved.

       We formulate a set of rules for quick reference, while the prose tries to motivate each of them. Do not always take them literally; you
       should value good reasons for your actions higher than manpages such as this one.
[...]       
{% endhighlight %}

Surprising.
